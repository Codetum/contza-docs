# Making content editable
This article explains how to make content on your website editable with Contza. By end of this page you will have your first editable text and image.

## Adding a Content Provider
In previous page you created a content which we can use in our code with [Content Provider component](/components/content-provider).
Simply import the `ContentProvider` from `@contza/react` package and add it to JSX. Add your content's slug as a prop (the same thing as when creating a content) and you are ready to move on.

```jsx copy
import React from "react";
import { ContentProvider } from "@contza/react";

const Page = () => {
  return (
    <ContentProvider name="index">
      {/* Rest of the page */}
    </ContentProvider>
  );
};

export default Page;
```

## Adding an editable text
Once you have setup the Content Provider you can start making a text editable by using Contza components inside the ContentProvider.
Simply import `ContzaText` from `@contza/react` and add it to your JSX like this.
```jsx copy
import React from "react";
import { ContentProvider, ContzaText } from "@contza/react";

const Page = () => {
  return (
    <ContentProvider name="index">
      <h1>
        <ContzaText>Page title</ContzaText>
      </h1>
    </ContentProvider>
  );
};

export default Page;
```

## Adding an editable image
You have now added an editable but how about an image? Well it's as easy as the text.
Simply import `ContzaImage` from `@contza/react` and add it to your JSX like this.
```jsx copy
import React from "react";
import { ContentProvider, ContzaText, ContzaImage } from "@contza/react";

const Page = () => {
  return (
    <ContentProvider name="index">
      <h1>
        <ContzaText>Page title</ContzaText>
      </h1>
      <ContzaImage>Page image</ContzaImage>
    </ContentProvider>
  );
};

export default Page;
```

## Editing the content visually
There are currently two ways to start editing your content in Contza.

You can just click the content in contents page and it will take you to the specific page you want to edit:

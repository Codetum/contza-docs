# Getting started

This article explains how to get started with Contza. By end of this page, you will have Contza ready to be used in your React application.

Start things off by installing the `@contza/react` package.
```console copy
yarn add @contza/react
```

## Setup Contza Provider
Wrap you React application with `<ContzaProvider />` component. Contza Provider basically shares it's context with all the other Contza components.
```jsx copy
import React from "react";
import { ContzaProvider } from "@contza/react";

const App = () => {
  return (
    <ContzaProvider>
      {/* Rest of the app */}
    </ContzaProvider>
  );
};

export default App;
```

Congratulations, you now have Contza fully setup to your project.

Now you can start adding Contza components to make your content editable!

# Getting started

This article explains how to get started with Contza. By end of this page, you will have Contza ready to be used in your React application.

## Create Contza website
Let's start things by [Creating a Contza account](https://app.contza.com/register).
After you have logged in to your account make sure you are on [My websites](https://app.contza.com/user/websites) page. Then click "Create website" button on the top right corner.
Give the website a name and a slug. Slug is just a human readable identifier for the website.

## Install packages
Install Contza React component library (required).
```console copy
yarn add @contza/react
```
If you would like to use features such as Static site generation (SSG) or [Server-side rendering (SSR)](/concepts/ssr), you should also install [@contza/client](/packages/contza-client) (optional).
```console copy
yarn add @contza/client
```

## Setup Contza Provider
Wrap you React application with `<ContzaProvider />` component. Contza Provider basically shares it's context with all the other Contza components.

Finalize the installation by adding the `websiteId` prop for ContzaProvider. You can found it from `My Websites -> Your Website -> Settings -> API Access`
```jsx copy
import React from "react";
import { ContzaProvider } from "@contza/react";

const App = () => {
  return (
    <ContzaProvider websiteId="your-website-id">
      {/* Rest of the app */}
    </ContzaProvider>
  );
};

export default App;
```

Congratulations, you now have Contza fully setup to your project.

Now you can start adding Contza components to make your content editable!
